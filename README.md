ofxTextSuite
============

Openframeworks Text Manipulation Suite


Originally forked from https://github.com/lukemalcolm/ofxTextSuite

This version implements ofxFTGL : https://github.com/HeliosInteractive/ofxFTGL ( forked from https://github.com/Flightphase/ofxFTGL , includes DEBUG lib ) 


The text rendered with ofxFTGL instead of ofTrueTypeFont 


ofTrueTypeFont is a bit slow and looks... well kinda crappy.


Released under GPL ( because that's what ofxTextSuite was originally released as ) 


Maintained by Ben McChesney of Helios Interactive


Big thanks to James George and Luke Malcom for their intial work. I just combined two libraries they did all the hard work.
